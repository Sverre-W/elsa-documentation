Elsa Workflows offers flexibility in how you can set up and run workflows. Whether you're looking for a quick console-based workflow or a full-fledged ASP.NET Core workflow server, Elsa has got you covered. In this guide, we'll walk you through the initial setup for various application types.

## **Prerequisites**

Before diving into the setup, ensure you have the following:

- .NET SDK (Version 6 or higher)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Rider)
- Basic knowledge of C# and ASP.NET Core

## **1. Elsa Console Application**

For those who want a quick introduction to Elsa or wish to test workflows without a server setup, the console application is an ideal starting point:

1. **Create a New Console Application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet new console -n "ElsaConsole" -f net8.0
   ```

2. **Install Elsa NuGet Packages**:
   ```bash
   cd ElsaConsole
   dotnet add package Elsa
   ```

3. **Define and Run a Simple Workflow**:
   - Use C# to define a workflow that prompts for a name and greets the user.
   - Execute the workflow within the console application.
