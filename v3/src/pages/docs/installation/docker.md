## Introduction

We are maintaining the following set of reference ASP.NET applications at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/elsaworkflows:

- [elsaworkflows/elsa-server-and-studio-v3](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/elsaworkflows/elsa-server-and-studio-v3)
- [elsaworkflows/elsa-server-v3](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/elsaworkflows/elsa-server-v3)
- [elsaworkflows/elsa-studio-v3](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/elsaworkflows/elsa-studio-v3)

This should make it easy to give Elsa a quick spin without having to create an ASP.NET application and setting up Elsa.

Before trying to run an image, make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.
